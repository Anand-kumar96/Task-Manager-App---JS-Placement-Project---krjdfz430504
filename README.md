### What I learned

While doing this project I have implemented the JavaScript functionality of checking different Node of element & class List using event Object and create different element ,also append it and also implemented render Function  for generating each task of each input. along with I learnt about local Storage and its different properties, apart from this I learnt different properties of Css. This Project really helped me to polish my Css skills as well as JavaScript skills to render something which was running in my mind for combining present, past and future time. I also learnt to implement HTML,CSS,JavaScript to meet design expectation.
